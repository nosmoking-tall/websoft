<h2>S01</h2>
<p class="ques">Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
<p class="answ">I know a little about git, github, github page. They are version control tools in order to update and backtrack code versions.I have been using same kind of tools in several projects before. However, i don't know markdown before, but since you mentioned it, i googled it. Now i know it's a kind of label language, more or less like html. Our readme.md page is written in this language.</p>
<p class="ques">Have you ever created websites before?</p>
<p class="answ">Yes, i have created an album before, using the Bootstrap framework. But it's not a satifying work. So i am not going to show you.</p>
<p class="ques">Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
<p class="answ">I know the components of a website. I have finished several dynamic web site before. So I would like to describe myself as freshman with certain basis. However, i don't know much about server-side coding. I have learned several language working for server-side before, but never have been using them before.
</p>
<p class="ques">What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
<p class="answ">
Today, i have got our learning schedule and framework. I have the outline of the structure of whole website. THere is also a lot of stuff I learned before, but Mikael help us review them in a more clear way like basic html language. I have been using git before but mostly through IDE or git Desktop, so i also learnt how to use git through command line which makes me looks more professional.
</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p class="ques">Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>p
<p class="answ">I have limited experience of HTML, CSS or JS. I only know quite basic knowledge of them. I haven't learnt them systematically before. Most situations are that when i have to use them, I search for similar code and learn from the pratices.</p>
<p class="ques">Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>
<p class="answ">HTML is a kind of label language to determine the building structure and components of the website. It seperates different part of a web page. It also includes the dependency of other files in different language or source from internet. HTML is the most close interface to users and on the most top layer of a website; CSS is used to describe the style of HTML elements. It help us to change similar or same label's style simultaneously in order to make web style consistent and complete from top to bottom. JS is used to pass the JavaScript is a web-based scripting language that has been widely used in web application development. It is often used to add a variety of dynamic functions to web pages to provide users with smoother and more beautiful browsing effects. Usually JavaScript scripts implement their own functions by embedding them in HTML. It is an interpreted scripting language (code is not precompiled). It is mainly used to add interactive behavior to HTML (an application under the standard universal markup language) page. It can be directly embedded in HTML pages, but written as a separate js file is beneficial to the separation of structure and behavior.</p>
<p class="ques">
    Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.
</p>
    <p class="answ">(a) the browser resolves the host name of the server from the URL;
(b) The browser uses the domain name resolution mechanism to translate the host name of the server into the IP address of the server; (how to use IP instead of the domain name directly, steps a and b can be omitted)
(c) the browser resolves the port number (if any) from the URL;
(d) The browser establishes a TCP connection with the Web server through the IP address and port number;
(e) The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server;
(f) the server sends back an HTTP response message to the browser;
(g) The connection is closed and the browser displays the document.</p>
<p class="ques">What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
</p>
<p class="answ">Today we learn the whole construction of the front end. We write our own introduction page. I finally have a chance learn the grammar and rules of front end language systematically. And I am now able to use JS make the html page more dynamic, ductile and flexible. </p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p class="ques">Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
<p class="answ">Only a little, it's the first time i formally learn about the client side JavaScript in details. I may use it for one or two times, but those are really basic and temporary use.</p>
 <p class="ques">  Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p> 
 <p class="answ">I want to compare the JS language to jave.
1) Object-based and object-oriented: Java is a true object-oriented language. Even if you are developing a simple program, you must design the object; JavaScript is a scripting language that can be used to make network-independent and interact with users Complex software. It is an object-based and event-driven programming language. So it provides very rich internal objects for designers to use;
2) Interpretation and compilation: Java's source code must be compiled before execution; JavaScript is an interpreted programming language, and its source code does not need to be compiled and interpreted by the browser;
3) Strongly typed variables and weakly typed variables: Java uses strongly typed variable checking, that is, all variables must be declared before compilation; variable declarations in JavaScript use their weak types. That is, the variable does not need to be declared before use, but the interpreter checks its data type at runtime;
4) The code format is different.</p>
<p class="ques">Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be? </p>
  <p class="answ">Actually JS is quite difficult for me. However, I am aiming for grade 4. My code is much more better than i imagined. I am quite satisfied with my code.</p>
  <p class="ques">What is your TIL for this course section?</p>  
  <p class="answ">I have learnt the basic standard style of JS, and a get the whole outline of function and basic code. However, most of content today is on client side with AJAX. We practice some example , and learn about the features of weakly typed variables.</p>

<h2>S04</h2>
    <p class="ques">Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>  
  <p class="answ">I have no previous experience of using node.js. The previous website i made are using php as language of server side scripts. So it's the first time I learned about Node.js.</p>
    <p class="ques">How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>  
  <p class="answ">I find it really convenient to use node.js and npm to build a website. A lot of code source and library can be used and installed. But the website I made is really easy, so I can't comment on how is node.js and npm performing on complicated web development. If I want build a prototype web page rapidly, npm and node.js is a good choice now.</p>
    <p class="ques">Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>  
  <p class="answ">Coding assignment is really easy to achieve. I follow the teacher's guide install the Node express and ejs. I learned the example code teacher gave us. After I understand teacher's code logic clearly like the dice, the other function like lotto is just changing several parameters.</p>
    <p class="ques">What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p> 
  <p class="answ">I am aiming for 4. It's quite simple.</p>
    <p class="ques">What is your TIL for this course section?</p>  
  <p class="answ">Well, it's the first time I learn and use Node.js, so basicly I have learnt about everything about Node.js and npm including coding and features. I learned that Node is a development platform that allows JavaScript to run on the server side. It makes JavaScript a scripting language that is on par with server-side languages such as PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby. Node is a platform built on the Chrome JavaScript runtime, which is used to conveniently build fast and responsive web applications. Node uses an event-driven, non-blocking I / O model to be lightweight and efficient, making it ideal for running data-intensive real-time applications on distributed devices.</p>

<h2>S05</h2>
    <p class="ques">How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</p>  
  <p class="answ">First of all, PHP is totally free for the enviroment and open source. What's more, PHP is a language that is very easy to learn and use. Its syntax is similar to that of C, but it does not have the complicated address operations of C. It also adds object-oriented concepts, plus it has a simple syntax The rules make it very easy to edit, and very practical. And PHP has really friendly interface to connect popular databses.</p>
      <p class="ques">Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</p>  
  <p class="answ">Again I am going to compare PHP with Jave. PHP is a scripting language, an interpreted language, and a weak type. It is designed for web development. Java is a C-based programming language, compiled, strongly typed, and cross-platform. In terms of succinct syntax, PHP is simpler than Java. After all, PHP was born later than Java. The same logic will be expressed concisely in PHP than in JAVA. The language characteristics determine the execution speed. There are also many comparisons on the Internet in terms of execution speed. In summary, Java is better than PHP, but in fact the comparison of the execution speed of the two is not significant, because the efficiency bottleneck of Web applications is related to the database.</p>
      <p class="ques">Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>  
  <p class="answ">For now, I aimed for grade 3. I am not satisfied with the result. I used to learn about php a bit, but the result is not so successful. The coding exercise is not so hard. I basically just made several modify on the example codes. But the operation on Mysql through php is not that easy.</p>
      <p class="ques">What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
  <p class="answ">Today, I learned the position of PHP in web development. I think maybe php is a little out-of-date. But in particular situations, php is still a very convenient server-side scripts to use. For very small projects, PHP is a very satisfying programming language. But for larger and more complex projects, PHP shows its weakness.</p>

<h2>S06</h2>
    <p class="ques">What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</p>  
  <p class="answ"> I think php and C#.net is more popular among students(at least in China).But I believe the future is belongs to Node.js. The convenience and impact of JS has already proved on the client-side, and it will be even better on the server-side.</p>
      <p class="ques">What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</p>  
  <p class="answ">I prefer PHP more, because it's really convenient for me to build a small project with php. And most important thing is that it's really easy to use and learn. And it's easy to connecting database.</p>
      <p class="ques">Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.</p>  
  <p class="answ"></p>
      <p class="ques">If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</p>  
  <p class="answ">I would definitely recommend node.js for several reasons.
  1. Concurrent connection, Asynchronous, event-driven model
The asynchronous mechanism and event-driven process do not block the connection of new users, and do not need to maintain the connection of existing users. Based on this mechanism, in theory, there are user requests to connect in succession, and NodeJS can respond. Therefore, NodeJS can support higher concurrency than Java and PHP programs. Although maintaining an event queue also requires costs, because NodeJS is a single thread, events The longer the queue, the longer it takes to get a response, and the amount of concurrency will still be weak.
NodeJS solves the problem of concurrent connections: change the way to connect to the server, each connection emits an event running in the NodeJS engine process and put it in the event queue, instead of generating a new OS for each connection Threads (and allocate some accompanying memory for them).
2. Non I/O blocking
Java and PHP also have ways to implement parallel requests (child threads), but NodeJS does it naturally through callback functions (Callback) and asynchronous mechanisms.
</p>
      <p class="ques">What is your TIL for this course section?</p>  
  <p class="answ">Today's lesson is quite interesting. We have an overview on different frameworks and languages. We compare several most popular language around the world and have a intuitive recognization on how they impace the whole development enviroment through data.</p>

<h2>S07</h2>
    <p class="ques">Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</p>  
  <p class="answ">
  The core of .NET is .NET Framwork (.NET Framework) is an environment for .NET program development and running. Under this platform, you can develop in different languages. 
  C# is a programming language under the .NET platform. A high-level language that runs on the .net CLR and is used to create applications. A programming language is a tool that facilitates communication between developers and computers.
  ASP.NET is a website development technology, an application model in the .NET framework, used to generate a rich programming framework for Web-based applications. </p>
      <p class="ques">Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</p>  
  <p class="answ">The third time, I am comparing .NET with Java. For the enviroment and framework, .NET is the .NET Framework and Java is J2SE. .Net is quick to get started. In .Net, Microsoft provides developers with a set of optimal technical architecture and integrated development environment. The system developed with Microsoft's technical architecture can guarantee the best results, without using Java. However, the rise of ios and Android makes .NET applications on the mobile phone basically no market, and the rise of these mobile applications will inevitably make Java and Object C ++ hot, further aggravating .NET's decadence. </p>
      <p class="ques">Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>  
  <p class="answ">I have learnt both java and C++ before, so I get familiar with C# quite rapidly. C# is very similar with java in many ways. With the previous practices and example of teachers, I solve the assignment easily.</p>
      <p class="ques">What is your TIL for this course section?</p>  

  <p class="answ">I get a chance to learn about C#, ASP.net and .NET framework. Actually it's quite popular in China. Although Java still occupied the biggest market share, but I am optimized about the future of C#. I also master how to set up .net enviroment and related IDE. I write my first website based on MVC framework and know the principle and components of MVC, how they work with each other.</p>

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/178XMXzrmFbKjpOFMugBjvz8oZqaGzLIHnSCnCfx4_O8/edit?usp=sharing">4 Google Data sheet</a>
<p class="answ">I compare the performances of three different search engines' index page. Baidu is the biggest search engine in China. Somehow, Lighthouse pagespeed can't test google for a period of time, luckily it works later. Results turn out to be quite interesting. Although Google has no resource at all, its performance is not as satisfied as I expect. Many kinds of test data like Time to Interactive, Max Potential First Input Delay, First Input Delay (FID) shows Google's index somehow perform worst among three search engines. I think one of biggest reason is different usage frequency and loading level of the server.(Everybody uses Google!). Look deeper in the details, we find scripting and idle is two most consuming part of producing delay. In China's Baidu engine, due to the far location of server, the idle time is so long that has exceed 5.5s. In the Network of Devtool, i find the reason of consuming such long time is loading 2 GIF, costing 2s each. Google's consuming time structure is like Baidu which also spend most time on loading gif, but Bing spend most time loading .aspx file.</p>

<h2>S09</h2>
<p class="ques">Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten.</p>
<p class="answ">
  I have really limited experience of dealing with security issues. So I do some research and conclude several most popular issues.
  1.XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a cross-site scripting attack. Because abbreviations and CSS overlap, it can only be called XSS. A cross-site scripting attack is an attack performed by an illegal HTML tag or JavaScript running in the browser of a registered web site user with a security vulnerability.
  2.SQL injection vulnerability (SQL Injection) is the most common type of security vulnerability in web development. You can use it to obtain sensitive information from the database, or use the characteristics of the database to perform a series of malicious operations such as adding users, exporting files, etc. It is even possible to obtain the highest permissions of the database and even system users.
  3.Click hijacking is an attack method for visual deception. The attacker embeds the website that needs to be attacked by embedding it in their own webpage, sets the iframe to be transparent, and reveals a button in the page to induce the user to click.
  4.The DDos attack is based on the DOS attack. It is easy to understand that dos is singled out and ddos is a group attack. Because of the development of modern technology, the lethality of the dos attack is reduced. So DDOS appeared. The attacker used a public network to combine a large number of computer equipment to attack one or more targets. From a technical perspective, DDoS attacks can be targeted at all layers of the network communication protocol. The methods are roughly: TCP-type SYN Flood, ACK Flood, Fraggle, Trinoo of UDP class, DNS Query Flood, ICMP Flood, Slowloris class and so on.
  These are secure issues I often heard about. I never suffer an attack before, but only by reading their principle and codes, I can imagine the harmful results and serious situations it may cause.
</p>
<p class="ques">Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.</p>
<p class="answ">1. Don't trust any external incoming data, perform related format checking, filtering and other operations on user input, and handle escape characters. The most common way is to escape the content of the input and output. Escape the parentheses, angle brackets, and slashes.
2. Use CSP content security policy.
3. X-FRAME_OPRIONS (X-Frame-Options) This can be said to be born to solve ClickJacking. It is an HTTP response header. It has a better support in modern browsers. It is to prevent clicks nested with iframe Hijack attack. The response header has three values, which are:
(1) DENY indicates that the page is not allowed to be displayed by iframe, (the browser will reject any iframe loaded by the current page)
(2) SAMEORIGIN indicates that the page can be displayed in the iframe under the same domain name, (the address of the frame page can only be a page under the same domain name)
(3) ALLOW-FROM indicates that the page can be displayed in the iframe of the specified source
4. Block third-party websites from requesting interfaces, do not trust any incoming third-party data, use CORS, and set Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
</p>
<p class="ques">What is your TIL for this course section?</p>

<p class="answ">Today I learned about the currently popular attack methods, principles and possible harms against web servers and websites. I didn't pay much attention to this before. After learning the importance of network security, I learned some techniques and methods to prevent these network attacks. I think that I must apply what I have learned in the development of commercial software in the future and be responsible for the customer's information security.</p>
