<h2>S01</h2>
<p>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
<p>I know a little about git, github, github page. They are version control tools in order to update and backtrack code versions.I have been using same kind of tools in several projects before. However, i don't know markdown before, but since you mentioned it, i googled it. Now i know it's a kind of label language, more or less like html. Our readme.md page is written in this language.</p>
<p>Have you ever created websites before?</p>
<p>Yes, i have created an album before, using the Bootstrap framework. But it's not a satifying work. So i am not going to show you.</p>
<p>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
<p>I know the components of a website. I have finished several dynamic web site before. So I would like to describe myself as freshman with certain basis. However, i don't know much about server-side coding. I have learned several language working for server-side before, but never have been using them before.
</p>
<p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
<p>
Today, i have got our learning schedule and framework. I have the outline of the structure of whole website. THere is also a lot of stuff I learned before, but Mikael help us review them in a more clear way like basic html language. I have been using git before but mostly through IDE or git Desktop, so i also learnt how to use git through command line which makes me looks more professional.
