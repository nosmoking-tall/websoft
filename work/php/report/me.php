<p>My name is Paul. I come from the mystic oriental ancient Country China. However, I haven't put any my skill points in Kongfu. Influenced by games like WOW, Minecraft etc., I have great interest in computer (games) since my childhood. Now I am a CS student learning software development and networking engineering. I finished my first three years of study in China and take bachlor prgramme in Kristianstad University.</p>

<p>I have learned PHP and basic knowledge of Web before. However, I know a little about Web frameworks or JS.</p>

<p>I want to get a high score in this class.Although i don't have any aesthetic background, I will try my best to get our website more approachable and tidy.</p>


<p>Lets keep in touch in the chatt and through GitHub!</p>
